                    I hope the movie is just as beautiful as the book! The book was and is a HUGE inspiration to me and shows the story of Hosea in such a wonderful way of how God will never let us go because He loves us.

                    A story well told. They cast took us in a journey. The story is told so well. The hidden gems like confessing her love was beyond amazing.
